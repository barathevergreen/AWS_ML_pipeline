-1,I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.,Blouses
-1,This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.,Blouses
-1,Like other reviewers have said  this is very sheer  look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other  tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose  billowy  and perhaps,Blouses
-1,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.,Blouses
-1,I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.,Blouses
-1,I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin  it might work for you too.,Blouses
-1,I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.,Blouses
-1,I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived  i thought it was a cute  different top  uniquely designed. when i tried it on  it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately  it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect,Blouses
-1,Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(,Blouses
0,I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n,Blouses
0,I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!,Blouses
0,I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined  but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.,Blouses
0,I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse  the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version  be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.,Blouses
0,The top is gorgeous and bohemian like with a loose fit. the top arrived with a small black stain and some of the lace already ripped. it might be too delicate for me to even exchange for another and wear. i am going to have to return it.,Blouses
0,Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.,Blouses
0,I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable  on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be,Blouses
0,I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6  137lbs  34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it  regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!,Blouses
1,This shirt is really quite cute. it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. it's also forgiving and quite flattering. my only concern is that it is a bit see through in certain lighting but it is very subtle. i definitely would recommend.,Blouses
1,I agree with others that this top runs small. i am usually a 2/4 in retailer tops and the small was very tight around the chest area. however  it looked so cute on! i wanted to buy it so badly  but it just didn't work for me. the design is absolutely adorable but i could not lift my arms without the whole top riding up. they did not have a medium in the store so i couldn't see if a larger size would work. overall  such a cute top  just not appropriate for someone my age or practical for someone ch,Blouses
1,I l o v e this sleeveless blouse for is soft tranquil print  wearability from day to night  comfort and fit! the design is flirty yet sophisticated-i wear it with skirts for work and jeans by night. can't say enough good things! everyone should have this beautiful piece in their wardrobe!,Blouses
1,This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!,Blouses
1,I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.,Blouses
1,Being six feet tall  i'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women  and i'm glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look  you can sometimes gain extra length  and it's true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues  and while it is billowy  it's not horribly so. i would think  however  if you're between sizes  or not worried about height  i'd go with the smaller option. adorable  comfy  casual while being dressy enough for a night out!,Blouses
1,The look is frest  crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!,Blouses
1,Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful  well made and so unique.,Blouses
1,Great top  for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'4 so can do it with top length  but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans  but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it  but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra  but probably would see other colors through it.,Blouses
-1,This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size  but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty  but background is more of a muddy gray  then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available  i'd have exchanged it  but it is going back.,Dresses
-1,I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!,Dresses
-1,Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.,Dresses
-1,After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black,Dresses
-1,I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very  very stiff. i was expecting something silky  or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case  it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice  but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o,Dresses

-1,"I am typically a small/6 in dresses  but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape  but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though  if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6"" 140 lb  i will return  too bad because it is a pretty dress!",Dresses
-1,This dress is beautiful and extremely well made... if you can get into it. the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back. it's form fitting  so you'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand. i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper  but it's soooo form fitting i'm afraid i wouldn't wear it.,Dresses
-1,I loved the dress  but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!,Dresses
0,"The dress fit fine  with two exceptions. first  i am 5'1""  and i ordered a petite 4. the dress was dragging on the ground  so it would need hemming if i were keeping it. but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my 34d figure  which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples. i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective  so sent it back  but unfortunately  the replacement fit the same way. the lining fabric fit",Dresses
0,I tried on the xs petite  and liked it but didn't love. the arm holes seemed big  you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides. also  the material is soft but thin (see through  somewhat). the xs petite  just seemed big overall  i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available. i am 115 lbs  30dd for reference.,Dresses
0,I didn't hate it  but i don't love it. i purchased it in 2 colors b/c i thought i'd fall in love. it is just ok. maybe it's b/c i have a larger chest  but i felt like it was too small in the chest area and too loose elsewhere. not the maxi fit i normally go for. however  the material is great and it's a simple sunday dress to lounge around in and run errands comfortably.,Dresses

0,My store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly $400 price tag that i decided to play dress up. the colors in person match the colors online  so that was nice to see consistency. overall though  i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks  which it did not. most items that fit my slender frame are too short  and this was no exception. the xs fit but i wouldn't be doing much moving  walking or dancing in this dress  which brings me to the question of,Dresses

1,This dress is easy and attractive. it's very soft and just slips on  but looks very put together. on my shorter frame  it's a bit long  more midi length  but it's so comfortable and pretty  that i'm fine with it; it looks a little bit 20's that way. recommended.,Dresses

-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,Fine gauge
-1,I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.,Fine gauge
-1,I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one  buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not,Fine gauge
-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish-burgundy.,Fine gauge

0,So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it  i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing  the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l  so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug  but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look  so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too  but i could have rolle,Fine gauge

0,This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,Fine gauge
0,This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!,Fine gauge
0,I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately  the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown  you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i,Fine gauge

0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates

0,This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,Jackets
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,Jackets
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets

-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering

1,"The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small  it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7"" 120lbs. if you want more room  i'd size up. it is low cut  but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows.",Layering
1,I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,Layering
1,"If your looking for a nice quality basic tee  this is it. nothing special  but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2""  35a/b bust  28 waist  39 hips.",Layering

1,There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...,Layering
1,Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft  smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!,Layering

1,Love this top! i'm 5'7  145 pounds  athletic build  and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut  so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment  but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back  as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality  and i would order this in more colors if it were available!,Layering

-1,This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.,Pants
0,These ran true to size  but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs  but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist  but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.,Pants
0,"I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11"" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs  the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally  this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas  and the waist tie ties way higher than",Pants
0,I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.,Pants
0,I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.,Pants
0,I tried this in an xxsp. i am normally an ssxp or xsp. it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie. not the look i was going for. if i sized up  the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame.     also  i don?t feel the quality matched the price point. the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously. that being said  it is a beautiful color and on the right body  the style would work well. it just wasn?t for me.,Pants
0,"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8"" too long in the leg  but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up  but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7""  and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs  this is a beautiful option. otherwise  i can't recommend it.",Pants
0,This jumpsuit is gorgeous...on the right body. if you have a tiny rib cage and a flat stomach and an average to short torso  this may fit you beautifully. on me  the defined gathered area you see in the photo was very tight and hit me in an odd place. the fabric is a great weight and it is a beautiful and rich looking. i really wanted this to work out for me. as for size  i found it just a little tight in the hips  waist and rib cage.,Pants
0,I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite  but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.,Pants

1,I purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot. you can dress it up or down  and since it's comfortable you will want to wear it a lot. i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner.. i bought 2 jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite. the fit is flattering  fitted but not tight and the self-tie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass. i am tall and i normally take an xs or s. i went with the s to ensure that it was long,Pants
1,I really was uncertain when ordering these because linen can be difficult. these are actually very flowy and soft. i do think they run a bit large. the petite sizes sold out so i ordered a regular 27. it stretched out a bit too much by the end of the day. if that's the case  you need to be careful because the hook and tiny belt are going to struggle to keep up. you should consider ordering down if you are in between sizes. otherwise  the rose color is beautiful  accurate to the website  and work,Pants

-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts

-1,I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.,Shorts
-1,"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",Shorts

0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,Shorts

0,These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!,Shorts
0,I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.,Shorts
0,These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall  but run large. depending on cut/style  i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these  and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero  but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!,Shorts
0,This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person  and as soon as i got it out of the bag  one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well  but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.,Shorts
0,I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,Shorts
0,I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,Shorts
0,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,Shorts
1,These are perfect for pulling off a finished look  proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial  lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!,Shorts

1,I like this robe a lot. the tassel detailing on the ties is beautiful. i like the soft interior-but wish it went all the way down the arms. the cozy part of the robe is only in the center section and hood-the arms can be a bit chilly while the rest of you is warm and cozy.  i do not think the robe is necessarily flattering  in that it does not do me favors in the way of slimming  it is more of a cozy-around-the-house robe rather than one to hide lingerie underneath.,Sleep
-1,"I'm petite  and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy  the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here  but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall  not a great sweater.",Sweaters
-1,This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site  so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug  cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty  its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.,Sweaters
-1,When i saw this item online  i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized  comfy look to it. the pros: very soft the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo  the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on  it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured  that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature  but because it was so detracting  i had,Sweaters

-1,I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad  because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...,Sweaters

0,This top does sit weird  feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down  probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.,Sweaters
0,Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling,Sweaters
0,This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.,Sweaters

0,I got this 25% off before christmas. i immediately started wearing it  thinking it would be a staple. i like the swing shape; the shape feels just right - not too baggy. but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals  collects lint like crazy  and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times. also  there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area (as you can see in retailer's picture). it looks out of place in person. i'm left loving the s,Sweaters
1,First off  the moment i put on  i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall  xs was a good alternative to medium petite.,Sweaters
1,Wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn. the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad. bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater!,Sweaters
1,My store had only one of these  in a size xs (i tend to be more of a s in most retailer items). it was roomy. i am 5'2  34d  & figured a petite small would be a perfect fit. i ordered the ps  it arrived today  & is still pretty big! the sleeves (which are quite flared) are a little shorter  as is the overall length  than the regular xs  but overall the ps feels just as big  if not bigger  than the regular xs! trying to decide if i should go back for the regular xs or order the regular xxs.,Sweaters
1,As stated by others  this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again. i would have given it 5 stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer. the sleeves are indeed long  although this adds to the coziness. but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been. i'm looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here. congratulations  retailer  for a winner!,Sweaters
1,This is my new favorite sweater. soft and comfortable and easy to wear to both work and play. being able to wear different things under this makes it very versatile and easy to change looks.,Sweaters
1,"I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large  but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style  it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly  plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of ""cozying up"" in colder weather by wrappi",Sweaters

-1,Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.,Swim
-1,While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!),Swim
-1,This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable,Swim
-1,Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!,Swim

-1,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,Swim
0,Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.,Swim
0,I adored this suit - the style  the colors  the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much  it was practically painful! i'm 5'7'  128 lbs  and usually wear a size small  but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on  everything fit well but the length  though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!,Swim

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
